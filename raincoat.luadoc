	A collection of loosely related utilities to make everyday Lua easier.

	For contributors:
	Raincoat modules should be kept separate and only depend on eachother when really necessary.
	The library should support minimalistic projects as well as larger ones, as such it should be well structured but low on dependencies and easy to simplfy and optimize further.
